            Screen printing, also known as silk screening, is a versatile and widely-used printing technique that involves transferring ink through a mesh or screen onto a substrate, such as fabric, paper, or plastic. This process is commonly used for creating vibrant and durable prints on a variety of materials. Here is a detailed explanation of the screen printing process: <br><br>

            1. Design Creation: <br>

            The process begins with creating a design that needs to be printed. This design is then transferred onto a transparent film, creating a stencil or screen. <br><br>
            2. Screen Preparation: <br>

            A mesh screen, typically made of silk or synthetic materials like polyester or nylon, is stretched tightly over a frame. The screen is then coated with a light-sensitive emulsion or film. <br><br>
            3. Image Exposure: <br>

            The film with the design is placed on the coated screen, and the entire setup is exposed to light. The light hardens the emulsion in areas not covered by the design, creating a stencil on the screen. <br><br>
            4. Washing/Developing: <br>

            The screen is then washed or developed to remove the unhardened emulsion, leaving behind the open areas corresponding to the design. These open areas allow ink to pass through the screen onto the substrate. <br><br>
            5. Printing Setup: <br>

            The prepared screen is mounted onto a printing press. The substrate, whether it's fabric, paper, or another material, is placed beneath the screen. <br><br>
            6. Ink Application: <br>

            Ink is applied to the top of the screen. A squeegee is then used to spread the ink evenly across the screen, forcing it through the open areas and onto the substrate below. <br><br>
            7. Printing Process: <br>

            The printing press is activated, and the screen is pressed down onto the substrate. The pressure forces the ink through the open areas of the screen, creating the desired design on the substrate. <br><br>
            8. Drying: <br>

            After printing, the substrate is moved to a drying area where the ink is allowed to dry or cure. This can be done through air-drying, heat curing, or using UV lamps, depending on the type of ink used. <br><br>
            9. Repeat for Multiple Colors: <br>

            For multi-colored designs, the process is repeated with different screens for each color. The screens are carefully aligned to ensure accurate registration of colors. <br> <br>
            Screen printing is favored for its ability to produce high-quality, durable prints on a variety of surfaces. It is commonly used in industries such as apparel, signage, promotional products, and fine art printing. The technique allows for a wide range of ink types and is suitable for both large-scale production runs and smaller custom projects. <br>
